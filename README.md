# The `mini` language

This is the official programming language `mini` website, designed in the [*Write a language in a week*](https://www.mini-lang.org/blog/) blog series.

`mini` is a minimal programming language that is built for the purpose of teaching programming language design.
The language is dynamically typed and expression-based. It is designed to be easy to learn and use. There are support for both functional and object oriented programming paradigms.

It is not intended to be a full language, but rather a language that can be expanded upon and explore new and more advanced concepts in language design.

<br/>

## Installation

The latest version of `mini` can be installed using the commands below:
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/mini-lang/mini-lang
> cd mini-lang
> py mini.py
```

> `mini` requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) version `3.0`, `3.6` or later.
