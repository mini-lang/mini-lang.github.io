# The `mini` language

This is the official programming language `mini` website, designed in the [*Write a language in a week*](https://dev.to/williamragstad/series/17603) blog series.

`mini` is a minimal programming language that is built for the purpose of teaching programming language design.
The language is dynamically typed and expression-based. It is designed to be easy to learn and use. There are support for both functional and object oriented programming paradigms.

It is not intended to be a full language, but rather a language that can be expanded upon and explore new and more advanced concepts in language design.

## Installation

Install the latest version of `mini` using the commands below.

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/mini-lang/mini-lang
> cd mini-lang
> py mini.py
```

The `mini` interpreter is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and requires version `3.0`, `3.6` or later.

### Persistent installation

1. Clone the repository to a program directory of your choice.
Suggested directory: `C:\Program Files`, `C:\Program Files (x86)` or `/usr/local/bin`.

2. Add the directory to your `PATH` environment variable. E.g. `/usr/local/bin/mini-lang`.

3. Done! Run the `mini` interpreter from any directory.
