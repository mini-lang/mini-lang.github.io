# 1. The Theory

> Warning! This article is still under construction!

To fully understand something, one must ask *why* until the most fundamental concepts unfolds.
Let's start with the most basic question.

## What is a programming language?
> A programming language is a formal language used by humans to write computer programs, consisting of a set of rules that define the structure. In addition to the languages themselves, a **compiler** is used to convert the program written in the language into a form that can be executed by a computer (a machine), or directly evaluated by an **interpreter**.

From the information given above, we can deduce that a programming language is simply the structural rules of the programs.
Like natural languages such as English, German, French, Spanish, etc., many programming languages share similar syntax and semantics, and use English as the base language for keywords and identifiers.
