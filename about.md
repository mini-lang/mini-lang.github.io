Hello! My name is William and I'm the author of this blog and the `mini` programming language project, among other things.
I'm a software developer and computer science student from [KTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTH_Royal_Institute_of_Technology) here in Sweden.
I'm *really* interested in programming languages.

`mini` is a small programming language that I'm working on.
It's a small, simple, and easy to use language that is designed to be easy to learn and use.

Here's where you can find `mini`:
* [GitHub](https://www.github.com/mini-lang)
* [Website](https://www.mini-lang.org)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mini_lang)

I hope you enjoy the `mini` programming language and the blog!
